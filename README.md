## Real Time Twitter Emotion Visualizer

This processing scripts works by first inizialing an arbitrary number of particles in the center of the screen. Then, for every iteration the script automatically gets the tweets with a specific search query, and analyzes their emotion. If this is positive, the particles will attract themselves. If it's negative, they will repel themselves. On top of this general principle, a tiny bit of brownian motion is added in order to get the graphical effect.
